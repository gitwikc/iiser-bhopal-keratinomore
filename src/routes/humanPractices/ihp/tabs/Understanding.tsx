        We recognized the importance of conducting our surveys of chicken shop
        owners with sensitivity and respect. We didn't want to come across as
        intimidating, insensitive, or disrespectful. To navigate this challenge
        effectively, we sought guidance from Dr. Renny Thomas, from the
        Humanities and Social Sciences Department at IISER Bhopal. Dr. Thomas
        emphasised the need to consider cultural nuances while formulating our
        survey questions. He encouraged us to be mindful of the diverse
        responses that different communities might have to our inquiries.
        Additionally, he advised us to conduct the interviews in the local
        language, creating a comfortable environment for the participants. This
        approach not only facilitated our research but also helped us establish
        meaningful connections with the chicken shop owners, fostering a
        positive and cooperative atmosphere during our surveys.

            <p>
              To understand the nature of the feather waste problem, we had to
              start at the root of it. In India and many other Asian countries,
              most chicken meat is sold at small shops, where the birds are
              butchered to order according to the customer's preferences. This
              is a massive part of the market, even though there are also
              large-scale chicken processing companies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our first step was to talk to and survey these small chicken
              retailers in Bhopal, where our college is located. We wanted to
              understand their practices and challenges to develop targeted
              solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              To do this, we interviewed small-scale chicken retailers in
              Bhopal, India. We surveyed 17 shops in different areas of the
              city. Some shops were new, while others had been family businesses
              for over ten years. All of the businesses reported an increase in
              sales in recent years. Still, some raised concerns about the
              instability and unpredictability of the market, especially after
              the COVID-19 pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we asked the retailers about their awareness of the global
              feather waste problem, they said they had little to no knowledge
              of it. We also asked the retailers about their methods of feather
              plucking. We learned that all of the shops use manual plucking,
              which can leave residual blood and skin on the feathers. This is
              an essential factor to consider when designing pre-treatments for
              the feathers.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also learned that since the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in 2014, the
              Bhopal Municipal Corporation has required small chicken retail
              shops to use separate bins for collecting feather waste. Municipal
              trucks collect the feathers along with other solid waste. However,
              none of the shopkeepers we interviewed knew what happened to the
              feathers after collection.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              When we asked what happens when the municipal truck doesn't come
              by, a few shopkeepers said they sometimes sell the feathers to
              local people who raise magur fish (Clarias gariepinus). Magur fish
              are banned in India because they threaten aquatic biodiversity.
              They thrive on poultry waste, pesticides, and human waste in
              contaminated ponds, posing severe health risks on consumption.
            </p>
            <p>
              In some cases, the shopkeepers said that they dump the feathers in
              a nearby canal when the municipal truck doesn't come by. This is a
              severe environmental problem, as feather waste can pollute the
              water and harm aquatic life.
            </p>
            <p>
              After our visits to the chicken shops, we visited the garbage
              treatment plant at Peer Gate in Bhopal. Municipal trucks deliver
              the collected solid waste, which is then sorted and segregated.
              The non-biodegradable, non-recyclable waste is processed further
              and eventually transported to the designated dumping yards at
              Adampur and Bhanpur.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Parallely, we came across this news article from Kerala, a south
              Indian state.{" "}

                output will be used as fish meal.
              </b>
            </p>
            <p>
              We learned that Kannur, a district in Kerala, India, has plans to
              set up rendering plants using steam-pressure treatments to degrade
              poultry feathers. This inspired us to reach out to chicken shops
              in Kerala. Coincidentally, one of our team members, Adithyan, is
              from Kerala, and through him, we had the opportunity to interview
              a few chicken shops from the region.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              The information obtained from the shops in Kerala was different
              from what we had seen so far. We found that there are already
              companies that exist to take care of this problem of feather waste
              and that the local government is not involved in this issue. The
              feathers subsequently are fed to fish and pork after some
              processing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We had a chance to interact with Mr. Jyothish O., Program Officer
              from Suchitwa Mission, the organisation which has been
              instrumental in setting up these rendering plants in Kerala. He
              told us that currently, there are 40 functional rendering plants
              which have the capacity to process 75% of the feather waste
              generated in the state. But such rendering plants fall under the
              Red Category of the Indian Pollution Control Board. There are also
              certain regulations in place for these plants to treat the
              polluting gases and wastewater generated though the treatment
              process.{" "}

            <p>
              We had the opportunity to visit Aditya Poultry Farm in Bhopal,
              owned by Aditya Gupta and Disha Gupta. They rear chickens for
              harvesting eggs, so the birds are not slaughtered at their
              facility. Their only source of feather waste is the shedding of
              the birds. As can be seen in the photos, the feathers are
              collected with the bird droppings below the shed where the birds
              are kept. The Guptas told us that in the moulting period of the
              birds, which is the natural process of shedding and renewing of
              feathers, the amount of feather waste generated rises
              significantly. The owners told us that the mix of feathers and
              droppings is collected by farmers from the nearby areas and used
              as fertiliser. Because of this practice, they had never faced a
              problem of managing the feather waste. While this is not an
              unsustainable method, there are some risks associated with it,
              such as disease transmission and nutrient imbalance.

            <p>
              Venky's India Limited is the largest poultry company in India and
              one of the largest in the world and we had the opportunity to
              interact with Dr. Prasanna Pedgaonkar, the General Manager of
              Sales and Marketing at Venky’s. Through this meeting, we learned
              that large-scale poultry processing units are required by law to
              have an in-house feather processing facility. Venky's uses
              steam-pressure methods or "rendering" to convert the feathers into
              ash, which is then repurposed. Dr. Pedgaonkar reiterated that
              these big companies make up about 5% of the market in India; the
              other 95% are small-scale chicken retailers. He told us that major
              municipalities across the country are struggling to deal with the
              sheer volume of feather waste being generated. This is due to the
              dispersed nature of the industry, as these shops are scattered
              across cities, making feather waste collection and disposal a
              problematic task. When we proposed our idea and its implementation
              to him, he said that it has the potential to solve a significant
              municipal solid waste problem, persistent in India and abroad.

                    In our conversation with Mr. Ravikant Audichya, Assistant
                    Health Officer at the Bhopal Municipal Corporation, we
                    learned about the current waste management practices. While
                    biodegradable waste is composted and recyclables are
                    recycled, feather waste, along with materials not sorted
                    into these categories, is dumped at Adampur or Bhanpur
                    dumping yard. This was in line with the information we had
                    gained through our visit to the Peer Gate garbage treatment
                    plant. Similar procedures are followed across the district.
                    To prevent contamination, the waste is transported in closed
                    trucks, with plans underway for an incineration plant.
                    However, these methods have significant environmental
                    repercussions, and this did not paint a rosy picture about
                    the current situation.

                    Kerala. Currently, local governments in Kerala have
                    contracted agencies to collect waste from the chicken shops
                    and transport it to rendering plants set up under Suchitwa

                    We had a series of meetings with Dr. Kumar because we were
                    unsure about designing a sustainable method to decompose
                    feather waste. In our first interaction, we introduced him
                    to the feather waste problem, how it is being currently
                    treated in India, and the side-effects of the current
                    treatments. We also explained to him our approach of using

                    author of the study "Field study of chicken feather waste
                    open dumping on road sides of Tuticorin city, Tamil Nadu,
                    India". He and his team found that chicken shop owners
                    dumped feathers in the open due to lack of better options
                    and awareness. This led to public health problems and an
                    increase in the stray dog population. However, he realised
                    that the problem persisted due to lack of responsibility on
                    the part of local governing bodies. His study led to some
                    positive change, as the municipal corporation now collects
                    feather waste from chicken shops, though it ends up in the
                    local dumping yard at Tharuvaikulam. But there are multiple

                    Through our previous work, we understood that there is some
                    residual blood and skin stuck to feathers after manual
                    defeathering. We consulted Dr. Sahu to understand the risk
                    of transmission of zoonotic diseases and infections to
                    humans through discarded feathers. He informed us that when
                    feathers are left to decompose naturally in the open or in
                    landfills, they can transmit diseases and infections. Blood
                    acts as a fomite (a non-living object that can carry and
                    transmit infectious organisms) and can help transmit
                    infections of Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, and
                    Campylobacter. However, the risk of transmission is
                    amplified when transport is involved. Dr. Sahu also informed
                    us that all of the bacteria mentioned above are mesophilic,
                    meaning they have an optimum growth range of 20 to 45 °C.
                    Through preprocessing, we should expose the feathers to
                    temperatures high enough to kill these bacteria.

                    Throughout our entire journey of understanding this problem,
                    we realised time and time again, that the problem of poultry
                    feather waste management is extremely unapparent and does
                    not receive enough attention. We had a chance to interact
                    with Dr. Jaydip Rokade, who is actively engaged in research
                    on the poultry industry. Dr. Rokade felt that the problem of
                    feather waste is unobvious because we don’t see its
                    magnitude. Feather waste is often mixed with other solid
                    waste and goes to the landfill or incineration plant.
                    Because of this, it is shielded from the public eye and as a
                    result, also the media. Moreso, he said that it falls under
                    the domain of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, so local governments

                    Throughout our entire journey of understanding this problem,
                    we realised time and time again, that the problem of poultry
                    feather waste management is extremely unapparent and does
                    not receive enough attention. We had a chance to interact
                    with Dr. Jaydip Rokade, who is actively engaged in research
                    on the poultry industry. Dr. Rokade felt that the problem of
                    feather waste is unobvious because we don’t see its
                    magnitude. Feather waste is often mixed with other solid
                    waste and goes to the landfill or incineration plant.
                    Because of this, it is shielded from the public eye and as a
                    result, also the media. Moreso, he said that it falls under
                    the domain of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, so local governments
                    need to take better steps to deal with it.
