            Working on Project KeratiNoMore, we believe in the profound wisdom
            of Robert Swanâ€™s words: "The greatest threat to our planet is the
            belief that someone else will save it". This principle has driven us
            to contribute meaningfully to the Sustainable Development Goals
            (SDGs) and to create a better world for us as well as future
            generations. The SDGs serve as our roadmap, guiding our efforts to
            address the pressing issue of feather waste accumulation and
            pollution. While our project has the potential to impact multiple
            SDGs, we have honed in on a select few that align most closely with
            our mission. Our journey has been one of collaboration and learning.
            We've engaged with a diverse range of stakeholders, from the common
            man to experts in the field, whose valuable insights have shaped our
            project. Together, we're working to develop a solution that's not
            only effective but also environmentally responsible and sustainable
            in the long term. In every step we take, we remain committed to our
            vision of leaving a positive mark on the world, one feather at a
            time.

                  Sustainable Development Goal 3 is dedicated to ensuring
                  healthy lives and promoting well-being for all, a fundamental
                  aspect of human development. In this context, it's crucial to
                  recognize how the unsustainable management of feather waste
                  can significantly impact health and well-being in various
                  ways. Traditional methods like incineration, which are often
                  used for feather waste disposal, have adverse health effects.
                  The burning of feathers releases harmful pollutants like
                  carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and
                  particulate matter into the atmosphere. Prolonged exposure to
                  these pollutants can result in respiratory tract infections,
                  chronic lung diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary
                  diseases, seriously compromising individuals' respiratory
                  health. Additionally, the practice of burying or landfilling
                  feathers has dire consequences for the environment. Feather
                  waste can contaminate surface water, groundwater, soil, and
                  air, posing severe health risks. These landfill sites can
                  become breeding grounds for pathogens such as Salmonella sp.,
                  Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus sp., and Clostridium sp,
                  causing diseases like typhoid fever, cholera, hepatitis E
                  infections, and food poisoning. Moreover, the presence of
                  feathers attracts rodents, further escalating health concerns.
                  Health regulations in many countries require keratin waste to
                  be disposed of through hydrothermal methods. This method
                  requires a high quantity of energy and addition of
                  concentrated acids or bases for breaking the tough peptide
                  bonds of keratin. Additionally, chemical hydrolysis requires
                  even more aggressive conditions and carries a greater risk to
                  the environment. It leads to emissions of harmful gases and
                  production of large amounts of wastewater.

                  In light of these challenges, our project, KeratiNoMore,
                  offers a sustainable solution. We propose a comprehensive
                  feather waste management approach that eliminates these health
                  risks. Through our method, feathers are treated to effectively
                  neutralise pathogens, significantly reducing disease
                  transmission risks. Furthermore, our microbial degradation
                  process provides an eco-friendly and efficient means of
                  breaking down feather waste into useful raw materials,
                  preventing the harmful consequences associated with
                  traditional disposal methods. By addressing the health and
                  well-being aspects of SDG 3, we contribute to a safer and
                  healthier environment for all.

                  Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) aims to create
                  sustainable, inclusive, and resilient cities and communities.
                  Feather waste management often presents a significant urban
                  environmental challenge, and our project, KeratiNoMore, aligns
                  with the mission of building more sustainable urban
                  environments. Through our extensive discussions with
                  stakeholders, we've gained insights into the pressing issue of
                  feather waste management within urban settings, especially in
                  India. In many municipalities, comprehensive mechanisms to
                  handle feather waste are lacking. Common practices include
                  landfilling, incineration, and uncontrolled dumping, all of
                  which pose significant environmental concerns. This
                  unregulated disposal contributes to pollution, disrupts urban
                  ecosystems, and jeopardises community well-being.
